00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.500
 Tomorrow's the annual brain clash, 10 teams of two competing in a decathlon of mental challenges, trivia competitions, and puzzles.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.200
 I've been training all year. I'll need to pick the smartest, most capable teammate.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.000
 I've narrowed down the roster.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:26.000
 First, we have Gabriella. She may only be 8, but don't underestimate her. She's fluent in two languages and is the ultimate outside-the-box thinker.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 Then there's Amma. She can reside 100 digits of Thai, designed satellites for a living, and makes a perfect souffle.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.000
 Or I could go with Mr. Taylor. He's the best chess player in the neighborhood, not to mention he's competed in over 20 brain clashes and is a five-time champion.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
 I'm not sure who to pick. Who's the smartest?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Which of these teammates should a mere choose for tomorrow's contest and why?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:06.000
 Of course, it depends. While intelligence is often associated with things like IQ tests, these assessments fail to capture the scope and depth of a person's varied abilities.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:16.000
 So instead, we'll break down the idea of "smart" into categories, like creativity, memory, and learning, and explore when the brains best at each of them.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 Let's start at the very beginning. In the first few years of life, your brain undergoes incredible rapid growth, called synaptogenesis,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 where more than one million new neural connections are formed every second.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
 As the brain develops, it goes through a pruning process.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 Based on your experience and environment, used connections are strengthened and unused connections are removed.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Frequently used, neuronal pathways are myelinated, wrapped in a layer of insulation, allowing information to travel faster.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:58.000
 This creates a more efficient, fine-tuned brain. But this brain remodeling happens within and between brain regions at different times, allowing different skills to flourish at different ages.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 For example, in childhood, brain regions involved in language learning develop quickly, which is why many children can learn and master multiple languages.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 Yet the prefrontal cortex, a brain region responsible for cognitive control and inhibition, is slower to develop.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:24.000
 As a result, some young children may struggle with strategic games such as chess or checkers, which require constant concentration, planning, and abstract thought.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
 At the same time, children tend to be more flexible, exploration-based learners.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
 They often use more creative approaches when finding solutions to riddles, and are on average less afraid to make mistakes.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 But adults have their own unique set of abilities.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:52.000
 Adults benefit from a well-developed prefrontal cortex, allowing them to better execute skills that require learning, focus, and memory, making them quick and efficient puzzle solvers or crossword masters.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
 Late in adulthood, these same skills may decline as the brain's memory center, known as the hippocampus.
